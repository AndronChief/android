removed a check in KEEP_SERVER switch clause. 1) The check prevents solving file conflicts (keep server) correctly. 2) The check involves FileUploader.LOCAL_BEHAVIOUR_DELETE, intended use is for media file uploads.
:Conflict files are removed from the upload storage manager after downloaded successfully.
